# Diabetes Prediction :
> Predict Diabetes using Machine Learning and UI built by PYWEBIO.


We have to predict whether the person is diabetic based on various features like *Glucose level, Insulin, Age, BMI*. We will perform all the steps from *Data gathering to Model deployment.* During Model evaluation, we compare various machine learning algorithms on the basis of accuracy_score metric and find the best one. Then we create a web app using Flask.



## Pywebio: 
 PyWebIO provides a series of imperative functions to obtain user input and output on the browser, turning the browser into a ‚Äúrich text terminal‚Äù, and can be used to build simple web applications or browser-based GUI applications. Using PyWebIO, developers can write applications just like writing terminal scripts (interaction based on input and print), without the need to have knowledge of HTML and JS. PyWebIO can also be easily integrated into existing Web services. PyWebIO is very suitable for quickly building applications that do not require complex UI.
